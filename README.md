# Job Description Notebook

The purpose of this project was to explore job postings for common tech fields. Although we certainly could expand the scraping we initially scraped for:
* Data Scientist
* Data Analyst
* Data Engineer
* Front End Developer
* Back End Developer
* Fullstack Developer

We scraped from numerous big tech cities including:
* San Francisco
* Denver
* New York
* Seattle
* Portland

Our initial goal was to determine what the most important and desired skills, packages, tech, etc. were from each field. However, it developed into an interesting project in determining how different some of these fields are actually from each other.

The web app is in development (http://ec2-34-229-237-160.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8105/submit?0), the css, js, and html were created using a bootstrapped method from (http://getbootstrap.com/).

The web scraping was done by Leo Walker (https://github.com/leowalker89).
